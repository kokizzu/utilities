# findCmpRm

This finds any files in the given directory \(by default: \.\) with the given
extension \(by default: \.orig\)\. It presents each file and gives the user the
chance to compare it with the corresponding file without the extension\. The
user is then asked whether to remove the file with the extension\. The command
name echoes this: find, compare, remove\. You will also have the opportunity to
revert the file back to the original contents\.
