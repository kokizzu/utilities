```
The testhelper package provides some useful functions for testing Go code. One
of the features it offers is to compare output against a 'golden' file. It also
supports generating goldenfiles and if a previous file of the same name already
exists it will replace it but keep the original in a file with a suffix of
'.orig'. This command will help you to review any changes and tidy up
afterwards.

The gosh program has a feature which simplifies editing files in place. Copies
of the files prior to editing are kept in files with the original name plus a
suffix of '.orig'. This command will help you to review any changes and tidy up
afterwards.
