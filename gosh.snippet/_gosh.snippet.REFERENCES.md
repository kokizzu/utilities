findCmpRm
```
A program to find files with a given suffix and compare them with corresponding
files without the suffix\. This can be useful to compare the installed snippets
with differing versions of the same snippet moved aside during the
installation\. It will prompt the user after any differences have been shown to
remove the copy of the file\. It is thus useful for cleaning up the snippet
directory after installation\.

This can be found in the same repository as gosh and this command\. You can
install this with &apos;go install&apos; in the same way as these commands\.
