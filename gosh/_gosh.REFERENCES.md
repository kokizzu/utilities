findCmpRm
```
This program can be used to verify any changes made when in-place editing (see
'-in-place-edit'). It will find all the files with a '.orig' extension and give
you the chance to compare them with the updated version and then to delete the
saved copy or to revert the file to the original content

To get this program:

go get -u github.com/nickwells/utilities/findCmpRm
