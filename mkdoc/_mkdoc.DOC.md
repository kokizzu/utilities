# mkdoc

This creates markdown documentation for any Go program which uses the param
package (github.com/nickwells/param.mod/*/param). It will generate a markdown
file containing examples if the program has examples and it will generare a file
containing references if the program has references. It will generate a main doc
file which will have links to the examples and references files if they exist.
This main doc file should then be linked to from the README.md file
