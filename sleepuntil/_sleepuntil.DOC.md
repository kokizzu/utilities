# sleepuntil

This will sleep until a given time and then perform the chosen actions\.

You can specify either a particular time of day to sleep until or some fragment
of the day or some regular period \(which must divide the day into a whole
number of parts\)\.

 So for instance you could choose to sleep until the next hour and it will wake
up at minute 00 rather than 60 minutes later\.

You can give an offset to the regular time and the delay will be adjusted
accordingly\.
