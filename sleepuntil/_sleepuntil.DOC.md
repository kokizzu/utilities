# sleepuntil

This will sleep until a given time and then perform the chosen actions\.

You can specify either a particular time of day to sleep until or some fragment
of the day or some regular period \(which must divide the day into a whole
number of parts\)\.

 So for instance you could choose to sleep until the next hour and it will wake
up at minute 00 rather than 60 minutes later\.

You can give an offset to the regular time and the delay will be adjusted
accordingly\.

## Parameters

This uses the `param` package and so it has access to the help parameters
which give a comprehensive message describing the usage of the program and
the parameters you can give. The `-help` parameter on its own will print the
standard parameters that the program can accept but you can also give
parameters to show both more or less help, in more or less detail. Other
standard parameters allow you to explore where parameters have been set and
where they can be set. The description of the `-help` parameter is a good
place to start to explore the help available.

The intention of the `param` package is to provide complete documentation
for the program from the command line.
